ChordBook Documentation:

The Chord Book package is it's own component separate from the rest of the workshop to provide a visual reference for chord styles for the instruments, along with key reference information.

Components and Classes:

        The Chord Book has arrays of images iterated over, along with other relevent information for each of the instruments. It includes buttons to move it's carousel left and right accordingly. 
        To keep things consistent, as the buttons get clicked, both the images and the alt text for the img tag gets shifted in its respective direction.
        

       handleRightClick() 
         goes forward through the carousel and images.

        handleLeftClick() 
         goes backward through the carousel and images.

        handleBlurb(event) 
        toggles the text shown below an image, and assigns tracked variables data based on object info.
