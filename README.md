# Musician’s Workshop - Project 3

## Project Description

The Musician's Workshop is a suite of applications designed for both musical learning and musical development. The Workshop provides a way to build chords, strum patterns, and save these as presets for later use. The Workshop also provides documentation on various musical keys and the chords that exist in these keys, as well as a Chord Book documenting the notes in the chord and the finger placements on a guitar. Finally, the Workshop features a metronome application and virtual instruments to aid in understanding how the notes are placed on a guitar, piano, or bass.
