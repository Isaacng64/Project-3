Music Utilities is a package that contains useful utilities and other functions that instruments and other components can utilize. Currently it 
only contains the basicUtils component, which provides musically useful functionality targeted primarily to a piano or similar instrument. It should be seen
as a starting point for what is possible, as it is far from feature complete. Currently, there is some basic support for setting up pitches defined as 
integers, and using those integers to mathematically define chords. 

basicUtils properties & functions: 

noteList -  This is used internally as a resource to map notes to pitches in a flat notation. 

pitchMap - This array contains our pitches once we've mapped them, using the index as the "pitch". Pitches are integers. 

keySignature - When this is set, it will contain the notes in flat format that are valid for the current key signature. 

keySignaturePitches - This gets set when the keySignature is set; it stores all of the integer values for valid pitches that exist in our pitch list. 

setPitchMap(finalVal, flatNoteVal) - This function is used to set our pitchMap. First define our total number of pitches and pass that as an integer, and 
follow that with the first note as a string in a flat format. (e.g. 'Bb' or 'D'). This MUST correspond to something in the noteList. 

getNoteFromPitch(pitch) - This function returns the note in flat format corresponding to the supplied pitch. 

getNotesFromPitches(pitches) - This function returns an array of strings in flat format corresponding to the supplied array of pitches. 

getMajorTriad(pitch) - This function returns an array with three pitches that are a major chord with the supplied pitch as the base note; if we're near the 
end of our pitchMap, the triad will become inverted if necessary. 

getMinorTriad(pitch) - This function returns an array with three pitches that are a minor chord with the supplied pitch as the base note; if we're near the 
end of our pitchMap, the triad will become inverted if necessary. 

getDiminishedTriad(pitch) - This function returns an array with three pitches that are a diminished chord with the supplied pitch as the base note; if we're near the 
end of our pitchMap, the triad will become inverted if necessary. 

setKeySignature(flatNote) - This function takes a note in flat format to define a key signature. 

setKeySignaturePitches() - This function is called by setKeySignature to define pitches that are valid for the current key. 

getValidChordInKey(pitch) - This function returns a valid chord based on the supplied pitch provided that the supplied pitch is in the current key and a key has
been set.

convertToSharp(flatNote) - This function converts a note in flat format to a sharp format; this could be useful for displaying to a user. 

convertToFlat(sharpNote) - This function converts a note in sharp format to flat format.
