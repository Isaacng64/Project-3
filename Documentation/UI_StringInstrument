String Instrument UI Documentation:

The String Instrument UI consists of 3 components each for both the guitar and the bass guitar. Each has a fret component, a string component,
and a component for the full instrument. Please note that these components all depend on the Audio Player component, which is what actually plays
the sound. Details on that can be found in the documentation for that package.

	Components and Classes:

		Instrument Component: This is the overall componet for bass and guitar instruments.
		
			currentFretAndString(): Event handler that catches the currentFret and stringNumber values from 
			the event that is fired from the string component.
			
			playBass()/playGuitar(): Queries audio player to play note from the currentFret and stringNumber
			values.
    
		String Component: This is the component for each individual string on the bass and guitar components.
		
			setFretInString(): Handles an event by getting the detail from it and sets the information to the 
			currentFret variable.
			
			strum(): This method gets the currentFret and stringNumber. This information is fired in a custom
			event that is then handled with the instrument component's playBass()/playGuitar() method.
			
			handlePressed(): Handles the onclick event for a single fret component being pressed. It changes the
			clicked on fret's image so that it is highlighted. It sets all other frets' images, those that 
			weren't clicked, to the default fret image.
			
		Fret Component: This is the componenent for each individual fret on the bass and guitar components.
		
			setFret(): Changes the pressed Boolean for the individual fret when it is clicked on and updates the 
			image for the individual fret based on the value of pressed and what string the fret is on. It also
			fires a custom event that changes the currentFret value to 0 when pressed is false and to the number
			of the fret when pressed is true.
