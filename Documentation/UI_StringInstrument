String Instrument UI Documentation:

The String Instrument UI consists of 3 components each for both the guitar and the bass guitar. Each has a fret component, a string component,
and a component for the full instrument. Please note that these components all depend on the Audio PLayer component, which is what actually plays
the sound. Details on that can be found in the documentation for that package.

	Components and Classes:


		Instrument Component: This is the overall frame for each instrument.


		Fret Component: This is the componenent for each individual fret on the bass and guitar components.
		
    
		String Component: This is the component for each individual string on the bass and guitar components.
