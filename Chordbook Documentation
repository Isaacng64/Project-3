Chordbook Documentation
In the current iteration, we have the ability to scroll through the images of the finger placements for each instrument. The instrument is passed from a previous component. The instruments have extra information associated with them, that information includes what keys the chord is in. Whenever a user clicks on an image the information for the keys appears. The images are static resources.

methods:

handleRightClick() 
 goes forward through the carousel and images.

handleLeftClick() 
 goes backward through the carousel and images.

handleBlurb(event) 
toggles the text shown below an image, and assigns tracked variables data based on object info.
